Project-2
=========

Problems:
  I have tried multiple times to get the font icons to be bigger and nothing has worked. I did everything that the video said to do as well as what you showed me in class. I dont know what i am doing wrong but I just cant seem to get it to work.


How:
  I used svg's that i built and designed in illustrator to create icon fonts to use. I used the service fontastic to upload my font icons.
